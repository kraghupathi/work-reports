  - Checking alerts for VLEAD
  - Checking disk space of Outreach portal VM everyday as well as all the lab VMs.

  - I have removed all the 2016-interns related data from the attendance portal at (http://attendance.vlabs.ac.in). And before doing this I have taken database backup and tested back with restoring the same on base4 container (16298).
