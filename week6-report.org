** From 9:30 AM TO 06:00 PM :
- Side by side I am also concentrating on learning python Programming
  Language. I took a python book written by US author for my complete
  reference. 
- After i finished reading complete chapter. I am solving all the problem
  related to that chapter.
- Here I have listed all the exercise that i have done so far. 
* Exercise1.
- Basics of Programming Concepts like what is Compiler, Interpreter and difference between Compiler and Interpreter with Examples of Interperter and Compiler.
- The building blocks of prgrams like input, output, sequential execution, conditional execution and reuse.
- What is python, why we use Python, bugs, Python Vocubalary, Syntax error, Logic error and Semantic erorr.
* Exercise2.
- Variables, Expressions,Values, Types, Operators and Operands, Order of Operators, Conditional Excecutions and Boolean Expressions.

* Exercise3.
- What is Function, why we use Functions, Function calls, what are built-in Functions, Parameters and arguments.
- String Operations and Logical Operators.

* 2016-Apr-01-Friday:
** From 9:30 AM TO 06:00 PM :
- To be updated
*Note :-* I have implemented source code for all python exercises planning convert
  them to literate programming and I will paste here the same code

** From 9:30 AM TO 05:30 PM :
- I tried to Setup DHCP server on CentOS. Before that I have read about DHCP server and taken various articles from online is available at [[http://www.krizna.com/centos/install-configure-dhcp-server-centos-6/][here]]
* DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that automatically assigns TCP/IP information to client machines.
   Each DHCP client connects to the centrally located DHCP server, which returns the network configuration (including the IP address, gateway, and DNS servers)
   of that client. 
** Why we use DHCP ?
 - DHCP is useful for automatic configuration of client network interfaces. When configuring the client system, you can choose DHCP instead of specifying an 
   IP address, netmask, gateway, or DNS servers. The client retrieves this information from the DHCP server. DHCP is also useful if you want to change the
   IP addresses of a large number of systems. Instead of reconfiguring all the systems, you can just edit one configuration file on the server for the new set of IP addresses.
   If the DNS servers for an organization changes, the changes happen on the DHCP server, not on the DHCP clients. When you restart the network or reboot the clients,
   the changes go into effect.
 - If an organization has a functional DHCP server correctly connected to a network, laptops and other mobile computer users can move these devices from office to office. 
** Advantages of DHCP-Server:
 - There is no need to manually configure each client with an IP address.
 - You don't need to keep a record of the IP addresses that you have assigned.
 - You can automatically assign a new IP address if you move a client to a different subnet.
 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to assign IP addresses and other stuff like gateway and DNS details automatically to the clients.
  we need a DHCP server configured for offering ipaddress to the clients when it is required.
* Installing DHCP server on Centos:
- Update yum repositories and packages by typing the below command
#+begin_example
[root@localhost ~]# yum update
#+end_example
- *Step 1* » Install dhcp server and client using the below command
#+begin_example
[root@localhost ~]# yum install dhcp
#+end_example
- *Step 2* » After installing dhcp server package along with dependencies .Assign a static ip (eg: “192.168.1.11”) in the same DHCP range for
  the listening interface ( eg : “eth0” ). Open =/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0= file and make the changes as per your requirement .
#+begin_example
HWADDR="00:0C:29:F1:01:4B"
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"
ONBOOT="yes"
BOOTPROTO="none"
IPADDR=192.168.1.11
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
#+end_example
- *Step 3* » Now open =/etc/sysconfig/dhcpd= file and add the preferred interface name to DHCPDARGS variable as below
#+begin_example
# Command line options here
DHCPDARGS=eth0
#+end_example
- *Step 4* » open =/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf= file and paste the below lines and save it.
#+begin_example
#specify domain name
option domain-name "krizna.com";
#specify DNS server ip and additional DNS server ip
option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.10, 208.67.222.222;
#specify default lease time
default-lease-time 600;
#specify Max lease time
max-lease-time 7200;
#specify log method
log-facility local7;
#Configuring subnet and iprange
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.254;
option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
#Default gateway ip
option routers 192.168.1.1;
}
#Fixed ip address based on MAC id
host Printer01 {
hardware ethernet 02:34:37:24:c0:a5;
fixed-address 192.168.1.55;
}
#+end_example
- *Step 5* » Now start the service
#+begin_example
[root@localhost ~]# service dhcpd start
#+end_example
- and type this below command to start dhcp service automatically while booting.
#+begin_example
[root@localhost ~]# chkconfig --levels 235 dhcpd on
#+end_example
*Note : -* It is giving =Failed= Error I need to trouble shoot this error.
