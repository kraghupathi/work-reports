- Today I gone through basics of networking concepts and various protocols, I read about protocols from online taken various articles.
* Network Topology:
- Network topology is the arrangement of the various elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network. 
  Essentially, it is the topological structure of a network and may be depicted physically or logically.
* Network:
- Network can be defined as a group of computers and other services connected together to exchangble data.
* Protocol:
- which is a rules and govern the communication between two computers connected by the network.
  IP address port range from 0-255
* Internet Protocol (IP):
- IP address is a number, which is used to indicate the location of a computer.
* IPV4:
- IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol Version 4. which is 32-bit addressing space used as TCP/IP host addressing mechanism. 
* IPV6:
- IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol Version 4.which is 128-bit addressing space.
* Public IP:
- A public IP address is an IP address that can be accessed over the Internet. Like postal address used to deliver a postal mail to your home.
- A public IP address is the globally unique IP address assigned to a computing device.
** Public Addresses

** From 09:30 AM TO 05:30 PM :
- Today I learned about basics of client-server architecture and read about few servers such as Apache (LAMP), DNS, DHCP, SSH and Bridge. 
* Server:
- server is a computer program that provides services to other computer programs (and their users) in the same or other computers.
* Router:
- Router is a device which is used to connect to the different network elements.
* Switch:
- switch is a device which is used to connect the same network elements.
* Web Server:
 - A web server is an information technology that processes requests via HTTP, 
   the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web.
 - The server is machine or programme that process the client request and send back the response.
* Client:
 - Cleint is a machine in which request a service from the server.
* XAMPP:
XAMPP is available with various distributions depends upon the OS.
- LAMP : For Linux
- WAMP : For Windows
- MAMP  : For MAC OS
- LAMP is a free and open source Linux web server tool kit package, It consisting of the Apache HTTP Server, 
   MySQL database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.
  
 - It is used as a development tool, to allow website designers and programmers to test their work on their own computers without any access to the Internet. .
* Apache Web server:
- Apache Web Server is an open source Web server for creation, deployment and management web applications.
- Which is designed to host one or more Web applications,
- It is also widely used by Web server many companies uses this server to host their internal web applications by configuring shared/virtual hosting,
  as by default, Apache Web Server supports and distinguishes between different hosts that reside on the same machine.
+ To install Apache-server on Linux, use the following command
#+begin_example
For Linux:= sudo apt-get install apache2
For CentOS:= yum install httpd
#+end_example
** How to host a website?:
1) To start the apache server, use the following command:
#+begin_example
For Linux:= service apache2 start
For CentOS:= service httpd start
#+end_example
2) open browser and type =localhost= or =127.0.0.1= then, browser displays the default apache page. If the default page is not found, then restart the apache server by using the following command.
#+begin_example
For Linux: service apache2 restart
For CentOS: service httpd restart
#+end_example
3) create a sample html, js and css files and place them in a folder. 
4) move the contents of the folder to  =/var/www/html= or =/var/www/=
5) open browser and type =localhost/<file name> or 127.0.0.1/<file name>.
#+begin_example
localhost/example.html
#+end_example
6) To stop the apache server, use the following command:
#+begin_example
For Linux:= service apache2 stop
For CentOS:= service httpd stop
#+end_example

* DNS-Server 
 - Domain Name System (or Service or Server), an Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses. Because domain names are alphabetic,
   they're easier to remember. The Internet however, is really based on IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name, therefore,
   a DNS service must translate the name into the corresponding IP address.
   EX : - 
   - To find the IP address of www.example.com. We use command as below
#+begin_example
nslookup www.example.com
#+end_example
The above command will give the ip address associated with =www.example.com= using DNS server.
* DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
 - DHCP is a Network protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP), Netmask, Default gateway, DNS entries to the host.
** Advantages of DHCP-Server:
 - DHCP is useful for automatic configuration of client network interfaces. When configuring the client system, the administrator chooses DHCP instead of
   specifying an IP address, netmask, gateway, or DNS servers. The client retrieves this information from the DHCP server. 
 - There is no need to manually configure each client with an IP address.
 - You don't need to keep a record of the IP addresses that you have assigned.
 - You can automatically assign a new IP address if you move a client to a different subnet.
* SSH-Server:
 - Secure Shell, is a protocol used to securely log onto remote systems. It is the most common way to access remote Linux and Unix-like servers,
   such as VPS instances.
****** Syntax:= The tool on Linux for connecting to a remote system using SSH is called
#+begin_example
ssh remote_host
#+end_example
 - The remote_host in this example is the IP address or domain name that you are trying to connect to.
 - This command assumes that your username on the remote system is the same as your username on your local system.
 - If your username is different on the remote system, you can specify it by using this syntax:
#+begin_example
ssh remote_username@remote_host
#+end_example
 - Once you have connected to the server, you will probably be asked to verify your identity by providing a password.
** Type the following yum command to install openssh client and server.
#+begin_example
yum -y install openssh-server openssh-clients
#+end_example
*** How Does SSH Work?
 - SSH works by connecting a client program to an ssh server.
 - In the above commands, ssh is the client program. The ssh server is already running on the remote_host that we specified.
 - The process needed to start an ssh server depends on the distribution of Linux that you are using.
 - You can start the ssh server on the VPS by typing:
#+begin_example
sudo service ssh start
#+end_example
 - That should start the sshd server and you can then log in remotely.
*** How Does Key-based Authentication Work?
 - Key-based authentication works by creating a pair of keys: a private key and a public key.
 - The private key is located on the client machine and is secured and kept secret.
 - The public key can be given to anyone or placed on any server you wish to access.
 - When you attempt to connect using a key-pair, the server will use the public key to create a message for the client computer that can only be read with the private key.
 - The client computer then sends the appropriate response back to the server and the server will know that the client is legitimate.
 - This entire process is done in the background automatically after you set up keys.
**** How To Create SSH Keys
 - SSH keys should be generated on the computer you wish to log in from. This is usually your local computer.
 - Enter the following into the command line:
#+begin_example
ssh-keygen
#+end_example 
 - Press enter to accept the defaults. Your keys will be created at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
 - Change into the .ssh directory by typing:
#+begin_example
cd ~/.ssh
#+end_example
 - As you can see, the id_rsa file is readable and writable only to the owner. This is how it should be to keep it secret.
 - The id_rsa.pub file, however, can be shared and has permissions appropriate for this activity.
***** How To Transfer Your Public Key to the Server
 - You can copy the public key to the remote server by issuing this command:
#+begin_example
ssh-copy-id remote_host
#+end_example
 - This will start an SSH session, which you will need to authenticate with your password.
 - After you enter your password, it will copy your public key to the server's authorized keys file, which will allow you to log in without the password next time.

* Bridge:
- Bridge is a device that connects two LANs and controls data flow between them.
- Especially bridge is a store & forward device. During the connection of different LANs, it receives the frame from one LAN and transfer the same
  frame without encapsulating or without modification to other LAN. By using local and remote bridge, a network administrator can easily extend the network distance.
* Switch:
 - Switch is a device, Which is used to connect same network elements.
** The difference between switch and bridge are
-  Bridge is is device which divides a network into two. Switch connects multiple networks.
-  Bridge are software based and switch is a hardware based.
-  Bridge can have upto 16 ports while switch can handle many ports.
-  Bridge is rarely used. Switches are frequently used. 
* Setting Up Bridge Network
** Introduction:
- This page explains about creating a bridge and setting up of a bridge network on base machine.
- The document further explains the step by step creation of this network.
- Seen below is the diagram of bridged network along with its Containers.
[[/home/raghu/Downloads/Untitled drawing(1).jpg]]
** Setting Up Bridge Network:
*** Connecting LAN Interface and Bridge:
- To make a connection to the bridge, LAN interface name should be known. It can be identified by using the following command
#+begin_example
ifconfig -a
#+end_example
- The first task is to create a bridge, let us call it br0 (br0=bridgename). Bridge is basically a file configured with essential
  settings which mentions the bridge name, boot protocol, on boot settings, type and if it is to be network manager controlled.
  Move to the network-scripts directory in =/etc/sysconfig= by following command
#+begin_example
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
#+end_example
- And create a file with name =ifcfg-br0= and write the following settings:
#+begin_example
DEVICE=br0
TYPE=Bridge
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=none
#+end_example
- Restart network service to effect the changes.
#+begin_example
service network restrat
#+end_example
- Following command can be issued to list all the bridges created and the interfaces they are connected to.
#+begin_example
brctl show
#+end_example
- The output has to bridge and any other bridges previously created with connected interfaces.
- With current configuration used, a sample output can be seen below:
#+begin_example
bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
br0		8000.5cf9dd75d1f8	no		
#+end_example
*** Creating Container:
- We next move ahead in creation of a container with following settings:
#+begin_example
Syntax:= vzctl create <CT-ID> --ostemplate <template> --hostname <host-name>
Ex:= vzctl create 201 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64-minimal --hostname centos
#+end_example
- set the netfilter to full for the container.
#+begin_example
Syntax:= vzctl set <CT-ID> --netfilter full --save
Ex:= vzctl set 201 --netfliter full --save
#+end_example
- The Container need to be connected to the bridge br0 and this is achieved by connecting with the respective interface. This is done by the following commands
#+begin_example
Syntax:= vzctl set <CT-ID> --netif_add eth0,,,,br0 --save
Ex:= vzctl set 201 --netif_add eth0,,,,br0 --save
#+end_example
- Start the container and set its status to running.
#+begin_example
Syntax:= vzctl start <CT-ID>
Ex:= vzctl start 201
#+end_example
*** Configuring Container:
- Enter the contianer
#+begin_example
Syntax:= vzctl enter <CT-ID>
Ex:= vzctl enter 201
#+end_example
- The ifcfg-eth0 file present in =/etc/sysconfig/network-script= directory for the container need to be configured with following settings
#+begin_example
Syntax:= DEVICE=eth0
         HWADDR=<<Hardware address of eth0>>
	 BOOTPROTO=static
	 ONBOOT=yes
	 NM_CONTROLLED=no
	 IPADDR=<<IP address of container>>
	 NETMASK=<<IP address of netmask>>
Ex:=     DEVICE=eth0
         HWADDR=00:18:51:20:58:72
	 BOOTPROTO=static
	 ONBOOT=yes
	 NM_CONTROLLED=no
	 IPADDR=10.11.12.1
	 NETMASK=255.0.0.0
#+end_example
- Restart the network service and check if the eth0 is assigned to ip-address or not (ifconfig command)
- The hardware address can be known by the command ifconfig -a.
- Note: Hardware address will be only available after adding the configuration files. The process is to first add the configuration without the hardware address,
  restart the service and later update it.
