* 2016-March-21-Monday
** From 10:00 AM TO 05:30 PM :
- I have gone through the basics of networking concepts and learned about
  various protocols.
- Here I choose Cisco Packet Tracer tool developed by =Cisco Organization= to
  understand more about networking formation, packet simulation and server configuration.
* Network:
- Network can be defined as a group of computers which are inter connected
  together to exchange the data.
- Sample network diagrame
[[./network.png]]
* Network Topology:
- Network topology is the arrangement of the various elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network. 
  Essentially, it is the topological structure of a network and may be depicted physically or logically.
 * EX := Bus Topology, Tree Topology, Ring Topology and Star Topology.
* LAN(Local Area Network):
- A LAN is a type of computer network in which networking facility is available in a small physical area (mostly in meters but very rarely in kilometers) probably in an office building, home and 
  school etc. Each computer or device connected to the network is called as a node.
** Uses of LAN:
-  LAN is useful for sharing resources like files, printer service, games or other applications.
** Examples of LAN:
- =Vlead Network= is an example of a LAN.
* WAN(Wired Area Network):
- A wide area network, or WAN, occupies a very large area, such as an entire country or the entire world. A WAN can contain multiple smaller networks, such as LANs or MANs. 
 * Ex := The Internet is the best-known example of a public WAN.
* Internet Protocol (IP):
- Internet Protocol is a unique address which is used to identify the
  computer/machine on a network.
- Which is used to identify the location of the computer in the world.
* IPV4:
- IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol Version 4. which uses 32-bits for address
  space and this uses TCP/IP host addressing mechanism.
- In which total address space is divided into 4 octets. Each octet value in
  decimal is 0-255.
 * Ex1 := 11000100.10101010.10101111.11010101
 * Ex2 := 175.56.43.23
- The above ip-address is in the dotted decimal number format. An ip address is in the format of 4 sets of decimal numbers separated by dots. The decimal number in each and every set is in the range 0 to 255. 
  Each and every set is called octet. So, there are 4 octets in an ip address.
** IP address classes:
- IPV4 address space is divided into several categerios for efficiant use of total address sapce. 
- Each class allows for a range of valid IP addresses, shown in the following table.
** Public IP:
- A public IP address is an IP address that can be accessed over the Internet. Like postal address used to deliver a postal mail to your home.
- A public IP address is the globally unique IP address assigned to a computing device.
 * Ex := 175.101.8.162
** Private IP:
- A private IP address is the address space allocated by InterNIC to allow organizations to create their own private network.
 * Ex := 10.2.59.109
** Static IP:
- Static IP is a fixed ip,it will not change
** Dynamic IP:
- It is an IP address is which is assigned by the DHCP server over network and
  it may change over time.
* Network Classes:
| CLASS A |   1.0.0.1-126.255.255.254 |  For Internet communication          |
| CLASS B | 128.1.0.1-191.255.255.254 |              Same as class A         |
| CLASS C | 192.0.1.1-223.255.254.254 |              Same as class A         |
| CLASS D | 224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255 | Reserved for Multicasting            |
| CLASS E | 240.0.0.0-254.255.255.254 | used for researching and experiments |
+ CLASS A 
 - First 8 bits indicates Network
 - Laster 24 bits indicates Host Address
+ CLASS B 
 - First 16 bits indicates Network
 - Laster 16 bits indicates Host Address
+ CLASS C 
 - First 24 bits indicates Network
 - Laster 8 bits indicates Host Addres


* IPV6:
- IPv6 stands for Internet Protocol Version 6. which uses 128-bits for address space and IPV6 denoted by eight groups of hexadecimal quartets separated by colons in between them.
 * Ex := 2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652
* Port:
- which specifies the process in the machine
- Port values range from 0-65535
* Port Numbers for given following Protocols:
| SSH   |    22 |
| HTTP  |    80 |
| HTTPS |   443 |
| FTP   | 20/21 |
| SMTP  |    25 |
| DNS   |    53 |
| DHCP  |    67 |
* Protocol:
- A Protocol is a set of rules which governs the communication between two
  computers which are connected by the network.
 * Ex := IP, HTTP and FTP etc.
** HTTP:
- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Which is responsible for
  loading/transfer the web data over internet.
- All browsing communication will happens using =http= protocal only.
- This protocal uses =80= protocal.
 * Ex := A browser is an HTTP client because it sends requests to an HTTP
   server (Web server), which then sends responses back to the client.  The
   standard (and default) port for HTTP servers to listen on is 80.
** FTP(File Transfer Protocol):
- The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol, which is
  used to transfer computer files between a client and server on a computer
  network.
- This will use port number 20/21

*Ex:-* Python File Sharing Server.
** SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):
- SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is generally used to
  send messages from a mail client to a mail server.
- This will use 25 port number. 
** TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol):
- TCP/IP is the basic communication language or protocol of the Internet. 
- It can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network
* VPN(Virtual Private Network):
- A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network technology that creates a secure network connection over a public network such as the Internet or a 
  private network owned by a service provider. And VPN can connect multiple sites over a large distance just like a Wide Area Network (WAN).
* Gateway:
- A gateway is a hardware device that acts as a "gate" between two networks. It
  may be a router, firewall, server, or other device that enables traffic to
  flow in and out of the network.
- A router is an example of a gateway device. A router is a device that does
  routing and decides where packets are sent to based on its IP address.
* Netmask:
- A netmask is a 32-bit number which is used to define how many bit of an IP
  address are related to hosts and network
- Netmask is used to define subnets and specify the network's available hosts.
- Netmask is used to identify the network address using binary operation with
  an ip and netmask.
| CLASS A |     255.0.0.0 |
| CLASS B |   255.255.0.0 |
| CLASS C | 255.255.255.0 |
* PING:
- Ping is a networking utility program. Which is used for verification of IP
  connectivity to the remote machine. This uses ICMP packets.
- To check connection between your machine to google.com server we use below command.
#+begin_example
ping www.google.com
#+end_example

** From 09:30 AM TO 05:30 PM :
- Today I have learned about hosting a website on apache server and various
  network elements and also i learned setting up bridge network using openvz
  containers.
* Apache Web server:
- Apache Web Server is an open source Web server for creation, deployment and management web applications.
- Which is designed to host one or more Web applications,
- It is also widely used by Web server many companies uses this server to host their internal web applications by configuring shared/virtual hosting,
  as by default, Apache Web Server supports and distinguishes between different hosts that reside on the same machine.
+ To install Apache-server on Linux, use the following command
 * On Ubuntu/Debian.
#+begin_example
sudo apt-get install apache2
#+end_example
 * On RHEL/CENTOS
#+begin_example
yum install httpd
#+end_example
** How to host a website on Apache Server?:
1) To start the apache server, use the following command:
 * On Ubuntu/Debian.
#+begin_example
service apache2 start
#+end_example
 * On RHEL/CENTOS
#+begin_example
service httpd start
#+end_example
2) To restart the server
 * On Ubuntu/Debian.
#+begin_example
service apache2 restart
#+end_example
 * On RHEL/CENTOS
#+begin_example
service httpd restart
#+end_example
3) Open web browser and type =localhost= or =127.0.0.1= then, browser displays
   the default apache page. 
4) Create a sample html, js and css files and place them in a folder.
 
5) Move the contents of the folder to  =/var/www/html= or =/var/www/=. This is
   the default web host server for apache server.
6) Open browser and type =localhost/<file name> or 127.0.0.1/<file name>.
#+begin_example
localhost/example.html
#+end_example
7) To stop the apache server, use the following command:
 * On Ubuntu/Debian.
#+begin_example
service apache2 stop
#+end_example
 * On RHEL/CENTOS
#+begin_example
service httpd stop
#+end_example
* Bridge:
- Bridge is a device that connects two LANs and controls data flow between them.
- Especially bridge is a store & forward device. During the connection of different LANs, it receives the frame from one LAN and transfer the same
  frame without encapsulating or without modification to other LAN. By using local and remote bridge, a network administrator can easily extend the network distance.
** The difference between switch and bridge
-  Bridge is is device which divides a network into two. Switch connects multiple networks.
-  Bridge are software based and switch is a hardware based.
-  Bridge can have upto 16 ports while switch can handle many ports.
-  Bridge is rarely used. Switches are frequently used. 
* Switch:
- Switch is a device which is used to connect the same network elements.
- Below Diagram explains simple network using switch.
* Router:
- Router is a device which is used to connect different network elements.
Note :  I will implement router in coming week.
* 2016-March-23-Wednesday
* Setting Up Bridge to form a sample network.
** Introduction:
- Here I explained about how to create a bridge on CentOS and how to form a sample network
  using bridge by connecting OpenVZ container.
** Creating a bridge: 
- Bridge is basically a file configured with essential settings which mentions
  the bridge name, boot protocol, on boot settings, type and if it is to be
  network manager controlled. 
- Change directory to network-scripts directory
#+begin_example
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
#+end_example
- To create the bridge, create a file with name ifcfg-br1 in the current
  directory including the following settings:
#+begin_example
touch ifcfg-br1
#+end_example
- Add the following configurations
#+begin_example
DEVICE=br1
TYPE=Bridge
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=none
#+end_example
 * Restart network service to effect the changes.
#+begin_example
service network restrat
#+end_example
 * Following command can be issued to list all the bridges created and the
   interfaces they are connected to.
#+begin_example
brctl show
#+end_example
- The output has to contain the created bridge and any other bridges previously created with connected interfaces.
  With current configuration used, a sample output can be seen below:
#+begin_example
bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
br1		8000.000000000000	no	         
#+end_example
** Diagram
- I have implemented a sample network which satisfied below diagrame
[[./Bridge2.jpg]]

** Creating private subnet:
- To test the settings we can create our own private subnet with three test containers.
#+begin_example
vzctl create 101 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64 --hostname centos-1
vzctl create 102 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64 --hostname centos-2
vzctl create 103 --ostemplate centos-6-x86_64 --hostname centos-3
#+end_example
- Note that ip address is not set for creating the containers.
- set the netfilter to full for the containers.
#+begin_example
vzctl set 101 --netfilter full --save
vzctl set 102 --netfilter full --save
vzctl set 103 --netfilter full --save
#+end_example
- The containers needs to be connected to the bridge br0.This is achieved by connecting with the respective interfaces. This is done by the following commands:
#+begin_example
vzctl set 101 --netif_add eth0,,,,br1 --save
vzctl set 102 --netif_add eth1,,,,br1 --save
vzctl set 103 --netif_add eth2,,,,br1 --save
#+end_example
- Start the containers and set its status to running.
#+begin_example
vzctl start 101
vzctl start 102
vzctl start 103
#+end_example
* Configuring Containers:
- Enter into the container 101
#+begin_example
vzctl enter 101
#+end_example
Change directory
#+begin_example
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
#+end_example
ifcfg-eth0 file should contain the following settings:
#+begin_example
DEVICE=eth0
HWADDR=00:18:51:9A:D8:E5
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
IPADDR=10.2.59.101
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
#+end_example
- Enter into the container 102
#+begin_example
vzctl enter 102
#+end_example
ifcfg-eth1 file should contain the following settings:
#+begin_example
DEVICE=eth1
HWADDR=00:18:51:97:0D:0C
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
IPADDR=10.2.59.102
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
#+end_example
- Enter into the container 103
#+begin_example
vzctl enter 103
#+end_example
- ifcfg-eth2 file should contain the following settings:
#+begin_example
DEVICE=eth2
HWADDR=00:18:51:86:A8:F3
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
IPADDR=10.2.59.103
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
#+end_example
- Restart the network services in all above containers 101,102 and 103 using
  below command  and check if the eth0, eth1 and eth2 are assigned to
  ip-address or not (ifconfig command).

#+begin_example
service networking restart
#+end_example
*Note :-* The hardware address can be known by the command =ifconfig -a=.
* Testing ping command among each container
- Now try to ping each container with one another if we are able ping each
  other then our network is formed successfully.
- ping 102 container from 103 container
#+begin_example
ping 10.2.59.102
#+end_example
- ping 101 container from 103
#+begin_example
ping 10.2.59.101
#+end_example
*Conclusion* I am able to ping above ip's
